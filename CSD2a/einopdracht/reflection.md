## Reflection about Blok2A:

This Blok, I learned the basics about Python Data- & Audio-Processing. My Key-Takeaway is the basic handling of multiple processes based on event timestamps.
This is a method, that I also use in other applications, that allow the user to interactively place sonic modules (effects, samples...) on a time axis; something approximating a DAW, but with more high-level interactivity.

Currently I am working on MIR-based Interfaces, that employ similar timestamp methods to automatize movie scoring using modular sounds and effects.
Without this module, I would lack crucial knowledge on how to do that efficiently.
