## Reflection about Blok2A:

This Blok, I learned the basics about Python Data- & Audio-Processing. My Key-Takeaway is the basic handling of multiple processes based on event timestamps.
This is a method, that I also use in other applications, that allow the user to interactively place sonic modules (effects, samples...) on a time axis; something approximating a DAW, but with more high-level interactivity.

Currently I am working on MIR-based Interfaces, that employ similar timestamp methods to automatize movie scoring using modular sounds and effects.
Without this module, I would lack crucial knowledge on how to do that efficiently.

Another takeaway is the design of prompted applications, that guide the interacting user and prevent crashes error handling and feedback, for instance if the false data type is input.


About the time-accounting:
I didn't keep track of my time, and wasn't aware that I should (as usual for things I don't get paid for).
My philosophy is to do as much as I can and aim for more than necessary.
